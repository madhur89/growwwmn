                <p>The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has gained prominence
                    from all avenues. Organizations have realized that government alone will not

                    concept of CSR has been looked upon as closely linked with the principle of
                    sustainable economic development, which requires the organizations to make
                    decisions not only based on financial factors but also on immediate and long
                    term social & environmental consequences of their activities.</p>

                    Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014 (hereinafter “CSR Rules), effective April 01,
